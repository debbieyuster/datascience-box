Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

# What is this course?

This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

--

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

--

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is **not** your typical high school statistics course.

--

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

---

# What is this course?

**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

--

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

--

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over `r emo::ji("coffee")`.

## Create a GitHub account

.small[
.instructions[
Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), and create an account (unless you already have one). 
]
]

Tips for selecting a username:<sup>✦</sup>

.small[
- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, etc.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

<!-- Once done, place a green sticky on your laptop. If you have questions, place a pink sticky. -->
Once you're done, open the Participants panel and click the green check mark. If you have questions, click the 'raise hand' icon (also in the Participants panel).

<!-- **Option 2.** -->

- On RStudio Cloud, start the assignment called `AE 01b - COVID`.
- If you'd rather not work with COVID data, you may instead choose  
`AE 01a - UN Votes`. 
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `covid.Rmd` (or `unvotes.Rmd`, if you chose the UN option). Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!
- Once done, make a Yes (green check mark) in Webex. If you have questions, raise your hand (click the Hand).

## How to get help

- Course content, logistics, etc. discussion on the Piazza discussion forum (linked in Canvas).
    - Please post questions here instead of emailing.
    - Use proper formatting: When asking questions involving code, please make sure to use inline code formatting for short bits of code or code snippets for longer, multi-line chunks.
- Often it's a lot more pleasant an experience to get your questions answered in person. Make use of office hours, I'm here to help!

---

## Tips for asking questions

- First search existing discussion for answers. If the question has already been answered, you're done! If it has already been asked but you're not satisfied with the answer, add to the thread. 
<!-- - Give your question context from course concepts, not course assignments. -->
<!--     - Good context: "I have a question on filtering" -->
<!--     - Bad context: "I have a question on HW 1 question 4" -->
- Be precise in your description:
    - Good description: "I am getting the following error and I'm not sure how to resolve it - `Error: could not find function "ggplot"`"
    - Bad description: "R giving errors, help me! Aaaarrrrrgh!” 
- You can edit a question after posting it.

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Tips for asking questions -->

<!-- - Format your questions nicely using markdown and code formatting. -->
<!-- - Where appropriate, provide links to specific files, or even lines within them, in the body of your issue. This will help your helper understand your question. Note that only the teaching team will have access to private repos. -->
<!-- - (Optional) Tag someone or some group of people. Start by typing the @ symbol and Slack will generate some suggestions.  -->

## Academic integrity

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work can be completed collaboratively.
- Use of disallowed materials during the take home exam will not be tolerated.

## Sharing/reusing code
- I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
- Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, you can use any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, RStudio Community) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). 
---

## Sharing/reusing code

- On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. 
- Except for the take home exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.
- On the take home exams all communication with classmates is forbidden.

## Course components:

- Teams: 3-4 person teams, initially based on survey, groups may change
- Lessons: Videos, readings, interactive tutorials
- Labs: Team, lowest score dropped - if you miss lab, contact me to make it up individually/with another absentee (same deadline)
- Homework: Individual, lowest score dropped. Pre-HW is interactive tutorial format, remainder of HW is done on RStudio Cloud and submitted as PDF on Gradescope
- Quizzes: Cover current video content (due Weds), and previous week's material (due Tues), lowest dropped
- Exams: Individual, two take home midterms
- Final project: Team, presentations during scheduled final exam time, you must participate in the project and presentation in order to pass this class
